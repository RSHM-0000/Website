 Closer to home, gravity also held sway. With most of the hydrogen and helium blown outward to the realm of the gas giants after ignition of the Sun, the inner Solar System had much less mass to play with, and most of that consisted of hard rocks—the stuff of chondrite and achondrite meteorites.

Mercury, the smallest and driest rocky planet, formed closest to the Sun. A hostile scorched world, this innermost planet appears to be dead and battered: its billions of years of intensely cratered surface is preserved under an airless sky. If you are ever asked to name objects in the Solar System where you’d bet against life, Mercury should top your list.

 Venus, the next planet out, is Earth’s twin in size but radically different in habitability, thanks in large measure to its orbit, almost thirty million miles closer to the Sun. It may have had a modest store of water early in its history, and even a shallow ocean, but subjected to the Sun’s heat and solar wind, most Venusian water appears to have boiled off, preventing that world from being wet. Carbon dioxide, the dominant gas in the thick Venusian atmosphere, sealed in the Sun’s radiant energy and created a runaway greenhouse effect. Today Venus’s average surface temperatures exceed 900 degrees Fahrenheit—hot enough to melt lead.

       Mars, one stop out from Earth, is a lot smaller—only a tenth its mass— but it is in many respects the most Earth-like. Like all the rocky planets, Mars has a metal core and a silicate mantle. Like Earth, it has an atmosphere and a lot of water. Its relatively weak gravity cannot easily hold speeding gas molecules in the upper atmosphere, so billions of years have eaten away at both air and water, and yet Mars still holds warm, wet underground reservoirs where life might maintain a tenuous refuge. No wonder most planetary missions have targeted the red planet. Earth itself, the “third rock from the Sun,” is smack in the middle of the habitable “Goldilocks” zone. It’s close enough to the Sun, and hot enough, to have relinquished significant amounts of hydrogen and helium to the outer realms of the Solar System, but it’s far enough from the Sun, and cool enough, to have held on to most of its water in liquid form. Like the other planets in our Solar System, it formed about 4.5 billion years ago, essentially from colliding chondrites and their subsequent gravitational clumpings into larger and larger planetesimals, over a span of a few million years.
